  Phase 1–2 facilitation for the Investor Deck Coach. Runs the orientation
  (stage, ask, audience) and discovery (what's-changed, what-you-do, traction,
  team) conversation. Produces PITCH.yaml and DISCOVERY.md. Invoke at session
  start to begin a new pitch or to resume a paused engagement.
user_invocable: true

# Discovery

When invoked, run the orientation and discovery phases of the pitch
facilitation. Produce `PITCH.yaml` and `DISCOVERY.md` in `.pitch/{slug}/`.

## When to invoke

- Founder wants to start a new pitch deck and no `.pitch/{slug}/` folder
  exists for the project.
- Founder wants to update an existing pitch with new discovery findings
  (e.g., new traction milestones, new team members).
- A previous session ended mid-discovery and needs to resume.

## When NOT to invoke

- After Phase 3 (`brand-discovery`) has run — discovery should be locked
  by then. Revise via the journal, not by re-running discovery.

---

## Execution

### Step 1: Triage existing state

Check whether `.pitch/{slug}/` exists.

- **If no folder exists:** new engagement. Continue to Step 2.
- **If folder exists with `PITCH.yaml` but no `DISCOVERY.md`:** resume —
  read `PITCH.yaml` and the journal, then continue Phase 2 from where it
  paused.
- **If folder exists with `DISCOVERY.md`:** confirm with the founder
  whether they want to revise existing discovery or start fresh. Do not
  silently overwrite.

### Step 2: Phase 1 — Orientation

One question at a time. Capture:

| Question | Outputs to |
|---|---|
| What are you building, and why now? | `DISCOVERY.md` §2 (placeholder) |
| What stage is the company at? | `PITCH.yaml` `stage:` |
| How much are you raising, and what does the capital buy? | `PITCH.yaml` `round:` |
| What kind of investor are you pitching? | `PITCH.yaml` `audience:` |

At the end of Phase 1, scaffold `PITCH.yaml` and `DISCOVERY.md` from
`pitch-templates/templates/`. Leave Phase 2 fields as `[TODO]` until
filled.

### Step 3: Phase 2 — Discovery

Continue one question at a time across these substantive areas. Sequence
is not strict — follow the founder's narrative thread, but ensure all
substance is captured.

**Substance to surface:**

1. **What you do** — one sentence, verb-first, BR-02-compliant. Push
   back if the sentence fails the competitor-substitution test.
2. **What's changed** — the discontinuous shift. Push back if the answer
   is generic ("AI is everywhere"). Demand a specific named change with
   evidence.
3. **Traction** — concrete numbers with cohort definitions. Push back on
   vague claims ("growing fast" → "what does month-over-month look
   like?").
4. **Pain** — in the customer's voice, with a concrete artefact (quote,
   metric, workflow).
5. **Solution** — what's built; the mechanism in one sentence.
6. **Team** — proprietary insight per founder; missing roles flagged.
7. **Initial competitive landscape** — named, not "various incumbents".

**Stage-specific emphasis:**

- Pre-seed: lean hard on team, why-now, and customer-discovery interview count.
- Seed: lean on pilot data, retention signal, and path to PMF.
- Series A: lean on cohort retention and CAC by channel.
- Series B: lean on sales efficiency, NRR, magic number.

### Step 4: Lock terminology

As terms surface that have multiple meanings (e.g., "CAC", competitor
product names), stop and lock them in `GLOSSARY.md` per CL-06 and ND-09.
Cross-reference the lock in `EXPLORATION_JOURNAL.md`.

### Step 5: Capture open questions

Anything the founder doesn't have evidence for becomes an entry in
`DISCOVERY.md` §9 "Open questions for Phase 4 (Market Research)".

### Step 6: Transition

When `DISCOVERY.md` is populated (or explicitly TODO'd for fields the
founder cannot fill), summarise back to the founder:

- The one-sentence pitch as you've heard it
- The "why-now" as you've heard it
- The traction as captured
- The biggest open question heading into research

If the founder confirms, propose `/idc:brand-discovery` as the next
step.

## Coaching gates

Throughout discovery, apply coaching-without-conflict:

- **Show, don't tell:** if a claim is weak, walk through it rather than
  declaring it weak. "Walk me through the math on that growth rate."
- **Observation vs judgement:** "I notice the traction list has four
  metrics — three are cumulative and one is monthly. Want me to walk
  through what each one tells an investor?"
- **Acknowledge complexity:** the founder knows their domain. If a
  surprising answer surfaces, ask before challenging.

---

## Refusals

Refuse, factually, if:

- The founder asks you to invent a customer quote → "I can't do that.
  Either we cite a real conversation, or we cut the quote, or we mark
  it as illustrative."
- The founder asks you to skip orientation ("just start with the
  market") → "The stage drives every threshold downstream. Five minutes
  here saves a lot of rework."

---

## Gotchas

- **Don't run discovery as a checklist.** It's a conversation that
  produces a structured artifact. Sequence follows the founder.
- **Don't let "we're building an AI platform" past as the one-sentence
  pitch.** Demand specificity.
- **Don't skip the journal.** Term locks made in discovery are
  load-bearing for every later phase.
- **Don't write `page-build-ready: true` on `DISCOVERY.md`.** Discovery
  is always provisional until market research is complete.

## Output checklist

Before declaring discovery complete:

- [ ] `PITCH.yaml` scaffolded with stage, round, audience, founders
- [ ] `DISCOVERY.md` sections 1–8 populated or explicitly TODO'd
- [ ] One-sentence pitch passes BR-02
- [ ] "Why now" names a specific shift with evidence pointer
- [ ] Traction stated with cohort definition (or pre-product noted)
- [ ] Open questions for Phase 4 captured
- [ ] GLOSSARY.md seeded with first term locks
- [ ] Journal entry written

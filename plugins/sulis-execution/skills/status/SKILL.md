# /sulis-execution:status

Read-only view of the Work Package INDEX state.

## Usage

```
/sulis-execution:status
```

No arguments. Reads `.architecture/{project}/work-packages/INDEX.md`
and produces a plain-English summary.

## What it shows

```
Work Package status:

✓ Done: 7
  WP-001, WP-002, WP-003, WP-004, WP-005, WP-006, WP-007

⏳ In flight: 1
  WP-008 — cancel-subscription flow (branch pushed; CI green; awaiting merge)

⚠ Blocked: 1
  WP-009 — staging cluster at capacity (BLOCKER-WP-009.md)

▢ Pending: 4
  WP-010, WP-011, WP-012, WP-013

▶ Next ready: WP-010 — webhook idempotency keys
```

For each blocked WP, shows the plain-English summary from the
BLOCKER record's `## Plain-English summary` section so the founder
or concierge can read the status without opening files.

## What it doesn't do

- It doesn't dispatch executors. Use `/sulis-execution:run-wp` or
  `/sulis-execution:run-all` for execution.
- It doesn't modify INDEX or any other file. Pure read.
- It doesn't follow dependsOn — it just shows declared status.

## When to use

- After a `run-all` session, to see where things landed.
- Before a `run-all` session, to confirm the starting state.
- When debugging — the INDEX is the source of truth, but `status`
  is the readable view.
- To resume after a break — see what's blocked and what's next
  ready.

- `agents/orchestrator.md` (ships v0.4) — uses similar logic
  internally to pick the next ready WP.
- The INDEX file itself at `.architecture/{project}/work-packages/INDEX.md`.

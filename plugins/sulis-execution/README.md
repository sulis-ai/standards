# Sulis Execution

**The Work Package Executor for the Sulis AI marketplace.**

Each Work Package is an atomic operation. Nothing is "done" until the
code is implemented, tested, merged to `dev`, deployed to staging,
health-checked, and smoke-tested. The Executor handles all of that
for one WP. The Orchestrator walks the INDEX and dispatches Executors.

## Quick start

```bash
# Run one WP
/sulis-execution:run-wp WP-007

# Walk the whole INDEX
/sulis-execution:run-all

# Check status
/sulis-execution:status

# Retry a WP that was blocked by an external issue
/sulis-execution:retry WP-007
```

## What the Executor does

For one WP, the 10-step lifecycle:

1. Create a `git worktree` off `dev` HEAD; cut a feature branch.
2. Write the failing tests (Red).
3. Write the minimum code to make them pass (Green) — checks for
   internal prior art before writing new code.
4. Refactor (Blue) — mandatory; extracts shared primitives.
5. Lint / type-check / boring-code-standard checks.
6. Commit (Conventional Commits) + push branch (CI triggers).
7. Poll CI; on green, squash-merge directly to `dev` (no PR).
8. Trigger Sulis SDK deploy to staging.
9. Poll health-checks until healthy.
10. Smoke-test the deployed change; mark WP `done` in INDEX; clean up
    the worktree.

## Self-healing

When a step fails, the Executor runs an OODA loop:

- **Observe** the failure output verbatim.
- **Orient** by running Five Whys to a single root cause.
- **Decide** the minimum change inside scope.
- **Act** by applying the change and re-running the failed step.

Bounded retry per failure type (Lint 5, GREEN 3, CI 3, Deploy 3,
etc). Scope guard halts on out-of-scope causes (CI infra broken,
platform down, broader regression). Escalation goes via a structured
`BLOCKER-WP-NNN.md` record that the Orchestrator and Concierge read
to surface plain-English status to the founder.

See `plugins/srd/references/executor-loop-standard.md` for the full
spec.

## Git workflow

Direct merge to `dev` on CI green — **no PR ceremony**. Branch
protection on `dev` enforces the CI-green status check; the merge is
the action. `main` is the production-deploy marker; promotion is the
founder's separate ceremony via the Concierge.

See `plugins/srd/references/git-workflow-standard.md` for the full
spec.

## What it's not

- It's not the architect (SEA designs).
- It's not the requirements analyst (SRD specifies).
- It's not the security reviewer (sulis-security audits).
- It's not the founder's product manager (the founder decides what
  the product is).

It's **the senior engineer**: takes a Work Package, ships it to dev
atomically. The Orchestrator and Concierge handle everything else.

# Audience-Adapted Question Framing Standard

<!-- summary -->
When an agent is about to ask a question, it first asks: *can the user answer
this?* If the choice has no user-facing consequence, or the consequence can
only be stated in technical terms, the agent does NOT ask — it takes the
established convention silently. Only questions answerable in business or
user-experience language ever reach the user, and they reach in concrete
scenarios the user can react to. The marketplace's default audience is a
non-technical founder, not a senior engineer. Agents must be expert
translators, not expert consultants.

## Provenance

This standard codifies a behaviour the existing rules don't reach. Convention
Preference (CP-01..CP-05) tells the agent *what* to recommend. Plain English
First tells the agent *not to use jargon*. Role Calibration tells the agent
*how often to coach*. None of them tell the agent *whether to ask the
question at all* when the user has no conceptual basis to answer it.

A production session revealed the gap. The founder was asked four
back-to-back technical decisions in α/β/γ notation. Three of them had no
user-facing consequence and were unanswerable by a non-expert. The fourth
was genuinely founder-facing but posed in incomprehensible language. The
founder's escape hatch was *"go with most boring, standard and expected"* —
the agent should have recognised that signal and taken the convention three
moves earlier.

Practitioner knowledge from production agent operation.

## Boundary Definition

This standard governs **question design and the decision to ask**. It does
not govern:

- Vocabulary substitution in narration (handled by Plain English First).
- Information density in artifacts (handled by CL-03 Expertise-Appropriate
  Design).
- Tone of feedback or correction (handled by Coaching Without Conflict).
- Choice of *which* convention to recommend (handled by Convention
  Preference).

This standard sits on top of all of those. It runs *before* the agent
formulates a question, deciding whether the question should exist and what
shape it should take.

Specific technology vocabulary is in scope (the translation lexicon below
needs concrete entries to be useful), but the principle is general: **the
default audience is non-technical; technical questions die at the triage.**

---

## Severity Convention

| Severity | Meaning |
|----------|---------|
| **MUST** | Non-negotiable. Violations block delivery. |
| **SHOULD** | Default. Deviation requires explicit justification. |

---

## AAF-01: The Three-Step Pre-Question Triage (MUST)

Before any question reaches the user, the agent runs three checks in
order. Each check terminates the triage when it fires. **The default
posture is silent action**: if a check is ambiguous, the agent takes the
convention and journal-records the decision — it does not ask. Permission-
seeking is the failure mode this rule is written to prevent.

```
1. Does this choice have a user-facing or business-facing consequence?
   (Apply the closed positive list below — default-deny.)
   → No   → Take the convention silently. Journal-record the decision
            under ## Decided-by-default with a one-line rationale.
            Continue. The user never sees this choice.
   → Yes  → Step 2.

2. Can the consequence be stated entirely in user-experience or business
   terms, with zero technical vocabulary?
   → No   → Take the convention silently. Journal-record. Continue.
            (The user has no input to give: they would be guessing.)
   → Yes  → Step 3.

3. Is the right answer obvious from:
     - the user's stated principles (VISION.md, PRINCIPLES.md, STRATEGY.md)
     - the target persona / first-user profile
     - a session-level instruction the user has given
       (see AAF-05 trigger list)
   → Yes  → Apply the principle. Announce the decision in the next response
            with a one-line rationale citing the principle.
            The user can override; default is to proceed.
   → No   → Ask. Frame in user-experience or business terms.
            Use the translation lexicon to convert any technical concept
            in the question text. Use a concrete scenario walkthrough
            (show, don't tell) when the trade-off is experiential.
            Never expose Option α/β/γ, technical terms, internal IDs,
            or implementation details in the question text.
            BEFORE EMITTING THE QUESTION: log the triage trace per AAF-07.
```

### Step 1 — the closed positive list (default-deny gate)

**A choice has a user-facing or business-facing consequence iff at least
one of these is true.** If none apply, step 1 fires and the agent takes
the convention silently. Do not rationalise marginal cases into
"consequence" — when in doubt, the answer is no.

A consequence exists if the choice:

- **Changes observable behaviour in the user's first 60 seconds of use.**
- **Changes pricing, cost to the user, or billing semantics.**
- **Changes activation, onboarding, or signup flow.**
- **Changes what the user sees in an error message they will read.**
- **Changes who can access what** (authorisation boundary the user
  understands as a business concept).
- **Changes data the user can see in a UI they will use.**
- **Changes scope** (what the system will or will not do at v1).
- **Changes a previously-confirmed user-facing decision** (e.g. a UC
  flow the user already approved).

If none of the above applies, **the choice does not have consequence and
step 1 fires.** The following categories are explicitly step-1-silent and
never become user-facing questions:

- Internal artifact reconciliation — rewriting an FR in place to match
  an already-locked decision, deleting a superseded artifact, replacing
  outdated wording with current convention.
- Identifier renumbering, ID-format changes, ID-collision resolution
  (FR-01 → FR-05, UC-08 step ordering, NFR-S04 → NFR-S07).
- Diagram additions for entities, state machines, flows already
  specified in narrative or already implemented in code.
- Glossary entries for terms already in use across artifacts.
- State-machine internals: initial state, recovery flows, idempotency-
  key handling, transition guards, retry/backoff, error envelope shape.
- Wording cleanup, status flips ("deferred" → "active"), version-history
  entries, formatting consistency, prose tightening.
- Convention-shaped technical decisions where the boring default has
  no perceptual difference (Decimal vs cents-as-int internally, named
  vs positional SDK parameters, JSON field ordering, log format
  details, file paths, module names, package layout).
- Pagination key shape, dependency choice between equivalent libraries,
  factory vs registry pattern, port naming, adapter shape.
- Test framework choice when multiple equivalent options exist.

This list is **exhaustive for the categories above** — agents do not
need to "be safe" and surface these. The convention from CP-01 is the
answer; the journal makes the decision transparent for later audit.

### Step 2 — technical-only consequences

Step 2 fires when a choice *has* consequence (per step 1) but the
trade-off cannot be stated in plain English. Example: PostgreSQL vs
DynamoDB when both meet all stated requirements — the trade-offs
(operational cost, consistency model, query patterns) require technical
vocabulary the user lacks. Take the TECH_RADAR ADOPT-ring default or the
CP-01 internal-prior-art default. Journal-record.

### Step 3 — survivals

Genuine founder decisions that survive both gates: pricing tier numbers,
target market positioning, brand voice, trade-offs that affect the
investor pitch, activation flow choices the founder has explicitly
flagged as strategic, UX trade-offs that change what the first user sees
in the first 60 seconds. These are asked — in plain English, with show-
don't-tell where the trade-off is experiential.

---

## AAF-02: Show, Don't Tell (MUST when posing a UX question)

For UX trade-offs that survive triage step 3, replace abstract options with
concrete scenario walkthroughs. The user reacts to lived experience, not
architectural categories.

### Pattern

> *"Here's what your first user sees in their first 60 seconds if I do A:
>  1. [step 1 from the user's POV]
>  2. [step 2 from the user's POV]
>  3. [step 3 from the user's POV]
>
>  Here's option B:
>  1. [step 1 from the user's POV]
>  2. [step 2 from the user's POV]
>  3. [step 3 from the user's POV]
>
>  A matches [user's stated principle / well-known company pattern].
>  B matches [different stated principle / different company pattern].
>  Which feels right for [target user / first founder]?"*

### Concrete example

For the Plan-selection question the analyst posed as Q-RD1 α/β/γ:

**Wrong (what was actually asked):**
> *"Confirm Option γ (implicit free-tier-at-signup + explicit paid-upgrade UC later)
> or deviate?"*

**Right (show, don't tell):**
> *"Here's what your first founder sees in their first 60 seconds if I do A:
>  1. Enters email, clicks Continue.
>  2. Lands in the product. Sees a starter project ready to deploy.
>  3. Free tier — no payment ever asked unless they hit a paid feature later.
>
>  Here's B:
>  1. Enters email, clicks Continue.
>  2. Sees a pricing page. Picks a plan. Enters payment details.
>  3. Then lands in the product.
>
>  A matches your easy-button principle (P8) and the pattern Notion / Vercel /
>  Lovable / Replit use. B matches a traditional B2B SaaS sales motion.
>  Which feels right for your first founder?"*

The user can answer the second one without knowing what "UC", "implicit", or
"explicit" means.

## AAF-03: The Translation Lexicon (MUST consult before posing)

Before any question reaches the user, scan it against the lexicon below. If
the question contains any term from the "Technical concept" column AND the
user did not introduce that term first, **either substitute the plain-English
equivalent or rewrite the question entirely**.

The lexicon is **open**. When an agent encounters a technical concept that
isn't covered, add it during the session (the analyst is empowered to
append) and surface the addition in the EXPLORATION_JOURNAL under
`## Lexicon Additions`.

### Seed lexicon

| Technical concept | Plain-English equivalent |
|---|---|
| OAuth / OIDC / SSO | "Sign in with Google/GitHub/Microsoft/etc." |
| Cursor pagination | "Load more as you scroll" |
| Offset pagination | "Page 1, page 2, page 3 — like Google results" |
| Idempotency key | "Won't double-charge if you tap pay twice" |
| Webhook | "We ping your system when something happens" |
| Polling | "Your system asks us every N seconds if anything's new" |
| Rate limiting / throttling | "Stops one user from overwhelming the service" |
| Free tier / freemium | "Use it free up to N; pay when you grow past that" |
| Implicit vs explicit subscription | "Auto-start free (Notion / Vercel) vs pick a plan first (B2B SaaS)" |
| Trial period | "Free for N days, then we ask for payment" |
| Cron / scheduled job | "Run something automatically on a timetable" |
| Async / queue / worker | "Kick off and we'll notify you when it's done" |
| Migration | "Move your existing data into the new shape" |
| Backfill | "Apply this to all the data that already exists" |
| Feature flag | "Turn a feature on for some users, off for others" |
| A/B test | "Show two versions; see which one users prefer" |
| API key / bearer token | "A password that lets the agent act on your behalf" |
| Refresh token | "How the agent stays signed in without re-asking you each time" |
| TLS / HTTPS / mTLS | "Encrypted in transit — what every legitimate website does" |
| At-rest encryption | "Encrypted on disk so a stolen hard drive is useless" |
| Schema | "The shape your data must fit" |
| Schema migration | "Changing the shape of data that's already in production" |
| Reconciliation | "Comparing two versions and resolving any differences" |
| Audit log | "A record of who did what, when — for compliance / debugging" |
| Distributed tracing | "Following one user's request through every system it touches" |
| Observability / metrics | "Knowing what your system is doing right now" |
| Circuit breaker | "If one service is broken, stop trying to call it for a while" |
| Retry with backoff | "If it fails, try again — but wait longer each time" |
| Health check / liveness / readiness | "Is the service alive? Is it ready to take traffic?" |
| Load balancer | "Spreads incoming requests across multiple servers" |
| CDN | "Copies of your static files near your users for speed" |
| Region / availability zone | "Where physically the data is stored — affects speed and law" |
| Database transaction | "Several changes that succeed together or fail together" |
| Eventual consistency | "It'll be correct in a moment, just not instantly everywhere" |
| Bounded context | "One self-contained slice of the business" |
| ADR | "A short note recording why we made a technical decision" |
| RFC / IETF standard | "A widely-agreed way of doing something on the internet" |
| UC (use case) | "A named scenario describing what someone does and what happens" |
| NFR | "A quality requirement — fast, secure, reliable, etc." |
| FR | "A thing the system must do" |
| TDD (Technical Design) | "The blueprint engineers follow to build the feature" |
| Primitive / domain entity | "A core thing in your business — like Order, Customer, Workout" |
| Decimal (vs cents-as-int) | "How we represent money exactly without rounding errors" |
| Tuple / struct / dataclass | "A named bundle of related values" |
| GraphQL vs REST | "Different ways APIs let you ask for data" |
| Container / Docker image | "Your code packaged with everything it needs to run" |
| Kubernetes | "The thing that runs and restarts your containers automatically" |
| Manifest (Sulis or k8s) | "A YAML file describing what should be running" |
| Bootstrap / genesis setup | "The one-time setup the platform operator does before anyone uses it" |

### When to use vs translate

- **Use the plain-English form when posing questions to a non-expert user.**
  The technical term may appear later in a journal, ADR, or artifact, but
  never in the question text.
- **Use the technical form** when documenting a decision, citing a standard,
  or talking with another agent. Internal vocabulary stays internal.
- **Match the user's register.** If the user introduces "OAuth" first,
  switch to the technical term — Plain English First's mirror rule still
  applies.

## AAF-04: Audience Score (MUST inform triage strictness)

The SRD analyst's Phase 1 Role Calibration produces a coaching level
(1 Novice / 2 Intermediate / 3 Experienced). Other agents perform similar
inference at session start.

**Step 1 is tier-agnostic.** The closed positive list at AAF-01 applies
identically regardless of audience tier. An Experienced user does not
license the agent to surface artifact-maintenance, identifier-renumbering,
state-machine-internal, or glossary-addition choices — those are
step-1-silent for every tier. The tier never relaxes step 1.

**Step 2 is tier-aware in framing, not in firing.** Step 2 fires the
same way for every tier (technical trade-offs that cannot be stated in
plain English get the convention taken silently). The tier affects only
whether the journal-recorded rationale uses technical terms or plain-
English equivalents.

**Step 3 framing strictness scales with the tier:**

| Audience score | Step 3 framing |
|---|---|
| **Novice (1)** | Show-don't-tell scenarios always. Lexicon substitution for every technical concept. Concrete user-experience walkthroughs preferred over abstract options. |
| **Intermediate (2)** | Show-don't-tell when the trade-off is experiential. Lexicon substitution always for terms the user has not used. Direct options acceptable when both sides are user-facing concepts (e.g. "monthly billing vs annual"). |
| **Experienced (3)** | Direct options acceptable when the user has demonstrated fluent technical engagement on this specific topic. Lexicon substitution still applies for unfamiliar terms. Show-don't-tell still preferred when the trade-off has a perceptible user-experience difference. |

**Critical:** the Experienced tier does NOT authorise surfacing of step-1
or step-2 questions. It only affects how step-3 survivors are *framed*.

**The Novice default is the marketplace's default.** Agents that cannot
run role calibration treat the audience as Novice unless the user signals
otherwise. **The audience score can be downgraded mid-session** but never
auto-upgraded — see AAF-05.

---

## AAF-05: Session-Level Escalation and Mid-Session Downgrade (MUST)

When the user gives any of the trigger signals below, the agent
**immediately downgrades the audience score to Novice for the remainder
of the session** AND escalates *Take silently* to cover all dev-experience
and implementation choices. Pending questions in the cycle stack are
re-triaged retroactively before the next user turn — anything that fails
the strict Novice triage is taken silently with a journal entry.

**Trigger signals — explicit escalation phrases:**

- *"Go with the boring default"*
- *"Most boring, standard and expected"*
- *"Trust your judgment"*
- *"Default to convention"*
- *"Defaults are fine"*
- *"Just take the standard"*
- *"Just decide it"*
- *"Stop asking me about this stuff"*

**Trigger signals — cognitive-overload phrases:**

- *"Feels like the agent is assuming knowledge"*
- *"Treat me as if I don't know"*
- *"I don't know what's right"*
- *"Stop asking me technical questions"*
- *"I'm not a software person"*
- *"This is too technical"*
- *"I'm lost"*
- The user asks a clarifying question about agent vocabulary
  (*"what does X mean?"* where X is a technical term)
- The user gives three consecutive *"I don't know, you decide"* or
  equivalent abdication responses

**Trigger signals are read for intent, not as exact-phrase matches.**
A user saying *"can you just pick the obvious one?"* matches the spirit
of *"just take the standard"* and triggers the downgrade. When in doubt
whether a signal counts, treat as a trigger — the downgrade is reversible
on explicit override.

Announce the downgrade once in the next response:

> *"Got it — I'll shift to plain-English mode and take implementation
> choices silently from here. I'll come back to you only when there's a
> real business or UX decision you need to make. Everything I decide is
> in the journal so you can audit at the end."*

The user revokes the escalation with any of:
- *"Slow down"*
- *"Check with me on each"*
- *"Walk me through more"*
- *"I want to see each decision"*
- Any explicit override of an announced default (e.g. *"actually use X
  instead"*)

**Re-upgrade is manual only.** The agent does not auto-promote a
downgraded user back to Intermediate or Experienced. Only an explicit
revoke signal (above) or a fresh session resets the calibration.

---

## AAF-06: Batch-Findings Output Contract (MUST when surfacing multiple findings)

When the agent has produced a batch of findings — typically from a
validation pass, an OODA cycle's Act step output, or a multi-perspective
review — it must NOT surface each finding as a separate question. Instead,
run each finding through AAF-01 triage and emit the result as three
explicit lists:

```
## Already done (N items)
- {finding} — {one-line rationale citing the AAF-01 step that fired}
- ...

## Done with announcement (N items)
- {finding} — applied {convention}; rationale: {one line}
- ...

## Need your input (N items)
- {plain-English question, no IDs, no jargon, scenario walkthrough where useful}
- ...
```

The agent posts the three lists, then begins the "Need your input" series
as one-question-at-a-time per the standard facilitation rule. The "Already
done" and "Done with announcement" lists are journaled but presented to
the user so they have the audit visibility without bearing the decision
burden.

**Forbidden output shape:** *"I found 7 things. Want me to do them all?"*
That's a meta-question that puts the user back in the decision seat for
items the triage already resolved. The correct shape is *"5 done, 2
announced, 1 question."*

**The validation skill** (`requirements-validation/SKILL.md`) MUST consult
AAF-01 per finding before listing it under "Need your input" — see
Perspective workflow.

---

## AAF-07: Question-Emission Self-Check (MUST before posting any question)

**Before posting any user-facing message containing a question, the agent
MUST log a triage trace to the EXPLORATION_JOURNAL.md** under
`## Triage Trace`. The trace records the AAF-01 result for each pending
question. Format:

```markdown
| Turn | Pending question (verbatim) | Step 1 | Step 2 | Step 3 | Emitted? |
|------|------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|----------|
| t37  | "When someone cancels..."   | pass   | pass   | ask    | yes      |
| t37  | "Add ST-05 diagram?"        | fail   | —      | —      | no — silent |
```

Step 1/Step 2/Step 3 fields carry `pass` / `fail` / `ask` / `silent` /
`announce` with a one-sentence rationale appended in a follow-up bullet
beneath the row.

**The mechanical effect:** writing the trace forces the check. Questions
that cannot justify a trace entry are not emitted. If the agent finds
itself about to ask a question without a corresponding trace row, that
is a violation — the agent stops, writes the trace, and lets the trace
drive whether to ask.

**The trace is internal.** The user does not see it during the
conversation; it lives in the journal as a debugging surface. A reviewer
auditing the session later can verify every emitted question survived
triage and every silent decision was the correct application of the rule.

**Mandatory for every emission cycle.** Even after a session-level
escalation (AAF-05 downgrade), each surviving question still requires a
trace entry. The trace is the audit trail.

- **CP-01..CP-05 (Convention Preference)** — the "convention" the agent
  takes silently in AAF triage steps 1 and 2 is exactly what CP-01..CP-05
  identify. AAF runs *after* CP has identified the recommendation; AAF
  decides whether to *take it* or *ask about it*. The two rules compose:
  CP picks the answer, AAF decides whether the user needs to hear the
  question.
- **Plain English First** (`requirements-analyst.md:1512-1530`) — narrower
  scope (vocabulary substitution in narration). AAF supersedes it for
  question text but PEF still governs free-form narration, journal entries,
  and summaries.
- **Role Calibration** (`requirements-analyst.md:351-372`) — the Phase 1
  role inference feeds AAF-04's audience score. Same input, second
  consumer.
- **CL-03 Expertise-Appropriate Design** (`references/cognitive-load.md:92-112`)
  — informs lexicon entries for technical-detail exposure in artifacts.
- **Coaching Without Conflict** — AAF respects all seven tenets when
  framing questions. The "Show, don't tell" pattern in AAF-02 is itself
  Tenet 5 applied to UX trade-offs.
- **Question + Convention-Default Assumption (QCDA)** — runs *after* AAF.
  If AAF says "Ask", QCDA shapes the question structure (anchored on the
  convention). If AAF says "Take silently" or "Take and announce", QCDA
  never fires — no question to shape.
- **Two-Model OODA Reconciliation** — unchanged. AAF triages what reaches
  the user from each OODA cycle's Act step. Reconciliation leaves
  categorised as `external-system` or `primitive-component` go silently
  through step 1; leaves categorised as `gap` proceed to step 2 and step 3.

---

## Anti-Patterns

### "I'll ask just to be safe"

The agent surfaces a question with no business or UX consequence, framed
"so the user can confirm." This is the failure this standard is written
against. Confirmations on technical-only choices burn the user's attention
without adding signal. The user has no information to give. Take the
convention and move on.

### "But what if the user wanted Option β?"

If the user has stated preferences (in VISION, PRINCIPLES, STRATEGY) that
distinguish Option α from Option β, AAF triage step 3 applies the
preference. If no such preference exists, the user has no basis to pick β
over α; the choice is genuinely indifferent to them and the agent takes the
convention. The user can override at any time by reviewing the journal or
saying *"slow down"*.

### "The user asked me to be thorough"

Thoroughness is a quality of the spec produced, not a measure of how many
questions were posed. A thorough spec with one founder-facing question and
forty technical decisions in the journal is more useful than a spec with
forty-one founder-facing questions that the founder answered randomly.
Thoroughness lives in the artifact, not the conversation.

### "Surfacing the choice makes it transparent"

The journal makes choices transparent. Asking *and then* journaling makes
them transparent twice — but doubles the user's cognitive load. The journal
alone is sufficient transparency for technical-only choices.

### "Permission-seeking with a trace"

A subtle variant: the agent runs AAF-07 self-check, the trace shows step-1
*fail*, and the agent emits the question anyway because it "feels safer to
ask." This is a triage-trace violation — the trace exists to enforce the
decision, not to document its override. If the trace says fail, the
emission does not happen. The trace is the gate, not the rationalisation.

If the agent finds itself wanting to ask a step-1-fail question for safety,
the right move is: take the convention, journal-record under
`## Decided-by-default`, and continue. The user can audit the journal at
the end. There is no "extra-safe" mode that lets the agent ask anyway —
that mode IS the failure this standard exists to prevent.

### "Experienced means I can be technical"

Pre-v1.11.1 a previous draft of AAF-04 contained a carve-out for
Experienced users: "Step 2 may surface technical trade-offs directly."
This was removed. **Audience tier never relaxes step 1 or step 2 triage**
— it only affects the framing of step 3 survivors. An Experienced user
who has been answering in technical shorthand is still owed silent
handling of artifact-maintenance, glossary, and state-machine-internal
decisions. The tier is about how to talk to the user; it is not a
license to ask more questions.

### "Process gravity wins"

When the agent is running a thorough validation pass (Phase 5,
multi-perspective review), the cognitive frame becomes "be thorough" —
which the agent interprets as "verify every finding with the user."
This is the failure mode the AAF-06 batch contract is written against.
**Thoroughness lives in the artifact, not the conversation.** A
spec with one founder-facing question and forty silent technical
decisions in the journal is thorough. A spec with forty-one questions
that the founder answered by guessing is not thorough — it is noise.

## Version History

| Version | Date | Change | Author |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0.1.0 | 2026-05-15 | Initial draft. Calibration period 90 days. Promotion to MUST repo-wide requires evidence from three sessions where the standard changed the outcome (fewer technical questions posed; user reported the session felt easier; spec quality not regressed). | Standards team |
| 0.1.1 | 2026-05-15 | Root-cause fix after v0.1.0 didn't fire in production. (1) AAF-01 step 1 rewritten with closed positive list of consequences — default-deny, no lexical wiggle room. (2) AAF-04 tier behaviour: Step 1 now tier-agnostic; tier only affects step 3 framing. Removed the Experienced "may surface technical trade-offs directly" carve-out that authorised the failure mode. (3) AAF-05 promoted SHOULD → MUST; trigger list extended to include cognitive-overload signals ("feels like agent is assuming knowledge", "I don't know what's right", "I'm not a software person", etc.); mid-session audience downgrade is now immediate with retroactive triage. (4) Added AAF-06 batch-findings output contract (Already done / Done with announcement / Need your input — three-list shape forbids "found N things, want me to do them?"). (5) Added AAF-07 question-emission self-check requiring a triage-trace journal entry before any question reaches the user. (6) Added four new anti-patterns. | Standards team |

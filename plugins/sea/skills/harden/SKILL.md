  Use after /sea:codebase-audit has produced Hardening Deltas the user has
  accepted. Implements the ADDED/MODIFIED/REMOVED changes specified in each
  delta — wraps unbounded calls in resilience policies, injects timeouts and
  circuit breakers, replaces hardcoded secrets with vault lookups, adds
  OpenTelemetry instrumentation, and writes the failing characterisation
  test alongside the fix. Marks each delta as `implemented` when its failing
  test turns green.

# Harden — Implement Accepted Hardening Deltas

When invoked, walk the queue of accepted Hardening Deltas and implement
each one. Each delta becomes a focused commit (or PR) following the
Red-Green-Blue cycle.

If arguments are provided, treat them as either:
- A specific delta ID (`/sea:harden HD-003`) — implement only that delta.
- A project name — implement all accepted deltas in dependency order.

If no arguments and one project exists under `.architecture/`, use it.
Otherwise list available projects and ask.

## What You Read

| Source | Why |
|---|---|
| `.architecture/{project}/hardening-deltas/HD-*.md` | The deltas themselves — ADDED/MODIFIED/REMOVED instructions |
| `.architecture/{project}/hardening-deltas/INDEX.md` | The acceptance order and dependency graph |
| `.specifications/{project}/MISUSE_CASES.md` (if present) | When a delta's `source` field references `srd:misuse-case-MUC-NN`, you read the originating misuse case for full context — the abuse pattern, the System Response (REQUIRED), and the related NFRs. The MUC is the load-bearing requirement; the delta is its implementation. |
| `.specifications/{project}/NFR.md` (if present) | NFRs derived from the adversarial sweep (rate limits, retention periods, integrity thresholds) often parameterise hardening implementations — e.g., MUC-02's rate-limit response references NFR-12's specific limit. |
| The codebase | The current state of the files the delta touches |

You only implement deltas with `status: accepted`. Deltas at `proposed`,
`rejected`, or `implemented` are skipped.

**Misuse-case-sourced deltas are first-class.** When a delta's frontmatter has
`source: srd:misuse-case-MUC-NN`, treat it as a contract bound to the MUC's
System Response — the test you write in Red must prove that the system either
refused/detected/logged/rate-limited the misuse pattern (as the MUC requires)
or did not before this delta. If you cannot construct that test, the delta is
not implementable yet — escalate to the user rather than relaxing the contract.

## Workflow Per Delta

For each accepted delta, follow the **Red-Green-Blue** cycle from
`references/red-green-blue.md`:

### 1. Red — Write the failing characterisation test

- Locate the test file named in the delta's `Verification` section.
- Write the failing test.
- Run the test suite — confirm the new test fails for the reason the delta describes.
- Commit: `test({HD-NNN}): characterise {gap} — RED`.

### 2. Green — Apply ADDED/MODIFIED/REMOVED

- Apply the file changes the delta specifies.
- Make the failing test pass.
- Run the broader test suite — confirm nothing else broke (this matters
  especially for MODIFIED changes; if it does break, that is a gap in the
  pre-existing test coverage — flag it and add the missing test before
  proceeding).
- Confirm code is "boring" per `references/boring-code.md`. No singletons,
  no hidden state, no metaprogramming, no `any` casts.
- Commit: `feat({HD-NNN}): {title} — GREEN`.

### 3. Blue — Refactor within scope

- Look for duplication introduced or revealed by the change (EP-03).
- Extract shared resilience primitives if 2+ instances now exist (e.g. two
  external calls now both use a timeout — extract a shared policy).
- Refactor stays in the file scope of the delta. Cross-file refactors that
  emerge become **new deltas** (file a follow-up delta, do not pursue
  mid-stream).
- Run the test suite — confirm Blue introduces no behaviour changes.
- Commit: `refactor({HD-NNN}): {what} — BLUE`.

### 4. Update the delta

- Update the delta's frontmatter `status: implemented`.
- Add an `implemented` block at the bottom recording the commit SHAs and date.

## What You Always Inject (Concrete Patterns)

For specific gap types, you use established libraries and patterns. Default
choices below — override based on the project's existing stack.

### Resilience (timeouts, retries, circuit breakers)

| Stack | Default library |
|---|---|
| Node/TypeScript | `cockatiel` or `opossum` |
| .NET | `Polly` |
| Java/Kotlin | `resilience4j` |
| Python | `tenacity` (retry) + `pybreaker` (CB) |
| Go | `failsafe-go` or hand-rolled with `context.WithTimeout` |

If the project already uses a different library, prefer that — consistency
matters more than the SEA default.

### Secrets

| Stack | Default backend |
|---|---|
| Anywhere on AWS | AWS Secrets Manager via SDK |
| Anywhere on GCP | GCP Secret Manager via SDK |
| Anywhere on K8s | External Secrets Operator + cloud backend |
| Local dev | 1Password CLI or Doppler (NOT `.env`) |

### Observability

- **Traces:** OpenTelemetry SDK + OTLP exporter. Always.
- **Logs:** Structured JSON, `trace_id` correlated. Pino (Node), structlog (Python), Logback JSON (JVM).
- **Metrics:** OpenTelemetry metrics API, exported via OTLP.
- **Dashboards:** Grafana (or equivalent), pre-defined panels per service.

### Encryption / mTLS

- Service mesh if one exists (Istio, Linkerd, Consul Connect). Reuse it.
- If no service mesh: client cert + server cert per service, rotated via
  cert-manager.

## Workflow When Implementing Many Deltas

1. Read `INDEX.md` for the dependency order.
2. For each delta in order (skip if `dependsOn` not yet `implemented`):
   - Run the Red-Green-Blue cycle above.
   - Commit per stage (3 commits per delta).
   - Update the delta's status.
3. After all deltas in this run are implemented, update `INDEX.md` with the
   new statuses.
4. Report: deltas implemented, deltas skipped (and why), tests added,
   coverage delta if measurable.

---

## When You Must Stop

- The delta's failing test cannot be constructed deterministically (e.g. it
  requires a chaos primitive the codebase doesn't have yet). Resolution: file
  a precursor delta that adds the chaos primitive, then return to this delta.
- The delta's MODIFIED change breaks a pre-existing test that has no obvious
  fix without changing the delta's contract. Resolution: stop, surface to
  the user, do not paper over by deleting the broken test.
- The delta touches code outside the audited scope. Resolution: stop,
  surface to the user, propose a new delta or scope expansion.
- Boring-code violations cannot be avoided in Green (e.g. the framework
  requires a decorator). Resolution: document the framework boundary in the
  delta's Rationale and proceed.

## Adapting Depth

- **Quick** ("just close the criticals") — implement only `severity: critical` deltas, skip the rest. Useful before a deploy that needs to ship now.
- **Full** (default) — implement all accepted deltas in dependency order.
- **Dry-run** ("show me what would change") — produce the diff per delta as a markdown report; do not apply changes. Useful for review.

---

## Gotchas

- **Never skip Red.** A delta implemented without the failing test first cannot prove the gap existed. The test is the evidence.
- **Never skip Blue.** EP-02 in CLAUDE.md is a non-negotiable. The REFACTOR step is mandatory.
- **Don't expand scope mid-delta.** If you discover a related gap, that is a new delta. Pursuing it derails the dependency graph.
- **Don't suppress pre-existing test failures.** If your delta's MODIFIED change breaks an unrelated test, that is a signal — either your change is wrong or the codebase has hidden coupling. Investigate; do not delete.
- **Don't rotate secrets in this skill.** Rotating live production secrets is operational, not code-level. The delta replaces the hardcoded literal with a vault lookup; the rotation is a separate runbook.

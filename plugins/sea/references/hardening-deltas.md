# Hardening Delta Format Standard

<!-- summary -->
A Hardening Delta (HD) is the artifact `/sea:harden` produces when auditing
brownfield code. Each delta describes one concrete change to existing code
that closes a gap against the [[mece-3-architecture]] pillars. The format is
adapted from the OpenSpec delta convention (ADDED / MODIFIED / REMOVED) and
extended with a Verification section that names the failing test that proves
the gap exists. A delta is not done until the failing test is written, the
implementation lands, and the test turns green.

## Provenance

The delta format adapts the OpenSpec change-proposal convention (Fission AI,
2026) for SEA's hardening domain. The Verification section follows the
characterisation-test discipline from Working Effectively With Legacy Code
(Feathers, 2004) — the failing test characterises current (broken) behaviour
before the change.

This is practitioner knowledge, not peer-reviewed research.

---

## Severity Convention

| Severity | Meaning |
|----------|---------|
| **MUST** | Non-negotiable. Violations block the delta from being accepted. |
| **SHOULD** | Default. Deviation documented in the delta's Rationale. |

---

## File Layout

Hardening Deltas live under the per-project architecture folder:

```
.architecture/{project}/hardening-deltas/
  HD-001-add-payment-timeout.md
  HD-002-redact-pii-from-logs.md
  HD-003-extract-circuit-breaker.md
  ...
```

Files are numbered sequentially. The slug describes the change in 3-5 words.
A delta is one logical change — not "harden everything in service X". If
service X has five gaps, that is five deltas.

## Required Sections

### HD-01: Header

**Severity:** MUST

```yaml
---
id: HD-003
title: Wrap payment provider call in circuit breaker
pillar: armor                 # form | armor | proof
gap_type: resiliency          # see HD-02
severity: high                # critical | high | medium | low
status: proposed              # proposed | accepted | implemented | verified | rejected
source_file: src/payments/provider-client.ts
created: 2026-05-12
---
```

### HD-02: Gap Type

**Severity:** MUST

The gap closes one specific category. Use one of:

| Gap Type | Pillar | Examples |
|---|---|---|
| `dependency-direction` | Form | Domain imports infrastructure |
| `module-coupling` | Form | Cross-module reach-through into internals |
| `timeout` | Armor | Unbounded HTTP/DB call |
| `retry` | Armor | Missing retry, or retry without backoff/jitter |
| `circuit-breaker` | Armor | No circuit breaker on external dependency |
| `bulkhead` | Armor | Shared thread/connection pool for unrelated workloads |
| `secrets` | Armor | Hardcoded credentials or secrets in env files |
| `encryption` | Armor | Plain HTTP, unencrypted storage, missing mTLS |
| `authz` | Armor | Missing authorization check; insufficient claim validation |
| `redaction` | Armor | PII/secrets leaking to logs, traces, error messages |
| `observability-trace` | Armor | Operation has no OpenTelemetry span |
| `observability-log` | Armor | Operation has no structured log with trace_id |
| `observability-metric` | Armor | Operation has no RED/USE metric |
| `contract-test` | Proof | Port has no contract test |
| `integration-test` | Proof | Boundary tested only with mocks |
| `chaos-test` | Proof | Resiliency primitive has no fault-injection test |

### HD-03: Context

**Severity:** MUST

A short prose section (2-5 sentences) explaining what currently happens, why
it is a gap, and what failure mode it enables. Reference specific file paths
and line numbers where the gap exists.

Example:

> The payment provider client at `src/payments/provider-client.ts:42` calls
> `fetch(url)` with no explicit timeout. The provider has been observed to
> hang for >30s during regional incidents. With no timeout, request threads
> accumulate, exhaust the connection pool, and cascade failure to unrelated
> endpoints. This violates MEA-04.

### HD-04: Change (ADDED / MODIFIED / REMOVED)

**Severity:** MUST

The delta uses three subsections borrowed from OpenSpec format. Include only
the subsections that apply. Each entry is a concrete code-level change.

```markdown
## Change

### ADDED
- `src/payments/resilience-policy.ts` — new file exporting `paymentCircuit`
  with timeout=2s, retry=2x with exponential backoff (200ms, 400ms), circuit
  breaker (5 failures in 30s opens, half-open after 60s).

### MODIFIED
- `src/payments/provider-client.ts:42` — `fetch(url)` → `paymentCircuit.execute(() => fetch(url, { signal }))`.
- `src/payments/provider-client.ts:1-5` — import resilience policy.

### REMOVED
- `src/payments/legacy-retry.ts` — old ad-hoc retry helper, replaced by policy.
```

### HD-05: Verification (Characterisation Test)

**Severity:** MUST

Every delta states the **failing test** that proves the gap exists today and
will prove the gap is closed once the delta lands. This is the Proof pillar
applied to the delta itself.

```markdown
## Verification

### Failing test (proves gap exists today)
- File: `tests/payments/resilience.test.ts`
- Name: `times_out_after_2s_when_provider_hangs`
- Setup: Use toxiproxy to inject 5s latency into the payment provider downstream.
- Expectation: The call rejects with `TimeoutError` within 2.1s.
- Current behaviour: hangs for full toxiproxy timeout (~30s) — test fails.

### Additional tests added by this delta
- `opens_circuit_after_5_consecutive_provider_500s` — chaos test for CB open
- `closes_circuit_after_recovery_window` — chaos test for CB half-open → closed
- `retries_with_backoff_on_transient_502` — retry behaviour test
```

### HD-06: Rationale

**Severity:** SHOULD

Why this specific approach, what alternatives were considered, and why they
were rejected. Keep to 3-5 sentences. Use this section to document trade-offs
the next reader will care about (latency budget, dependency added, etc.).

### HD-07: Sequence

**Severity:** SHOULD

If the delta depends on another delta, name it: `dependsOn: [HD-001]`. If
the delta blocks others, name them: `blocks: [HD-007, HD-009]`. This drives
the `hardening-deltas/INDEX.md` graph.

## Worked Example

`.architecture/payments-service/hardening-deltas/HD-003-add-payment-timeout.md`:

```markdown
---
id: HD-003
title: Wrap payment provider call in circuit breaker
pillar: armor
gap_type: circuit-breaker
severity: high
status: proposed
source_file: src/payments/provider-client.ts
created: 2026-05-12
dependsOn: []
blocks: [HD-004]
---

## Context

The payment provider client at `src/payments/provider-client.ts:42` calls
`fetch(url)` with no explicit timeout, no retry, and no circuit breaker.
The provider has been observed to hang for >30s during regional incidents
(see INC-2026-04-12). Request threads accumulate, exhaust the connection
pool, and cascade failure to unrelated endpoints. This violates MEA-04
(every external call has a timeout, retry, and circuit breaker).

## Change

### ADDED
- `src/payments/resilience-policy.ts` — `paymentCircuit` with timeout=2s,
  retry=2x exponential backoff (200ms, 400ms), circuit breaker (5 failures
  in 30s opens, half-open probe after 60s).

### MODIFIED
- `src/payments/provider-client.ts:42` — `fetch(url, opts)` →
  `paymentCircuit.execute(signal => fetch(url, { ...opts, signal }))`.

### REMOVED
- (none)

## Verification

### Failing test (proves gap exists today)
- File: `tests/payments/resilience.test.ts`
- Name: `times_out_after_2s_when_provider_hangs`
- Setup: toxiproxy injects 5s latency on payment provider downstream.
- Expectation: rejects with `TimeoutError` within 2.1s.
- Current behaviour: hangs ~30s — test fails.

### Additional tests added
- `opens_circuit_after_5_consecutive_provider_500s`
- `half_opens_after_60s_recovery_window`
- `retries_with_backoff_on_transient_502`

## Rationale

Considered: simple timeout only, full bulkhead with dedicated pool. Rejected
simple timeout (still cascades pool exhaustion on slow provider). Rejected
full bulkhead (over-engineered for single downstream; revisit when we add a
second provider — HD-008). Circuit breaker is the minimum sufficient
intervention.

## Sequence

- dependsOn: (none — provider client is self-contained)
- blocks: HD-004 (payment fallback delta needs the circuit breaker's
  `isOpen()` to decide when to invoke the fallback path).
```

## How `/sea:harden` Uses This Format

1. Scans the source tree for gaps in each MEA pillar.
2. Groups gaps by file and gap-type.
3. Emits one HD-NNN file per logical change.
4. Builds `hardening-deltas/INDEX.md` ordered by `severity` then `dependsOn` graph.
5. Each delta starts at `status: proposed`. The user accepts deltas one or in
   batches. Accepted deltas become Work Packages on the implementation queue.

---

## Gotchas

- **One gap, one delta.** Do not bundle "harden all of service X" into one
  delta. The delta graph cannot express bundled work and the failing-test
  discipline gets diluted.
- **Failing test first.** A delta without a failing characterisation test is
  not accepted. If you cannot write a test that proves the gap exists today,
  reconsider whether it is actually a gap.
- **Status transitions are linear.** `proposed → accepted → implemented → verified`.
  Skipping `implemented` because "the test passes locally" is not allowed.
- **Severity is operational, not aesthetic.** "high" means "production
  incident probable within the next 90 days". Don't inflate severity for
  unrelated cleanup.

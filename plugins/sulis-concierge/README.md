# Sulis Concierge

**The Sulis AI marketplace's single entry point for non-technical founders.**

Founders don't need to know which agent does what or when to invoke
them. The Concierge runs the whole journey from "I have an idea" to
"my product is built, tested, and security-reviewed" — in plain
English, with specialists invoked behind the scenes at the right time.

## Quick start

```bash
claude --agent sulis-concierge
```

The Concierge will greet you and ask what you're trying to build.
That's it — you answer plain-English questions; it does the rest.

## What the Concierge does

1. **Greet** you and capture your goal in plain English.
2. **Check** what already exists in your project (greenfield or
   brownfield).
3. **Help you specify** what the product needs to do (via a guided
   conversation with the requirements analyst).
4. **Get the technical design** drafted (via the engineering architect).
5. **Build it** (via the work-package executor).
6. **Verify** the build matches the design.
7. **Security-review** the finished product.

Every step is announced before it happens. You never have to remember
which command to run — the Concierge tells you when needed (in v0.1) or
runs it for you (in v0.2+).

## How the marketplace organises itself

The Concierge invokes specialist plugins on your behalf:

- `sulis-context` — discovers existing project material.
- `srd` — facilitates requirements gathering through guided conversation.
- `sea` — designs the technical architecture, breaks it into tasks,
  verifies the build.
- `sulis-execution` — actually writes the code, one task at a time,
  using Red-Green-Blue test-driven discipline.
- `sulis-security` — assesses for security/business risk issues.

For non-build paths (pitch decks, brand identity, business strategy),
the Concierge points you to:

- `idc` — investor deck coach.
- `sulis-design` — design system and visual identity.
- `sulis-strategy` — vision, strategy, pricing, GTM.

## What makes this different

The marketplace agents (SRD, SEA, sulis-security) are highly specialised
— they use technical vocabulary appropriate for their domain. Without
the Concierge, the founder has to know which to call, when, and how to
translate their output.

With the Concierge:

- One command to start: `claude --agent sulis-concierge`.
- Every output translated to plain English before you see it.
- Journey state persists across sessions in
  `.concierge/{project}/JOURNEY.md`.
- Specialists are invoked only when needed; you're never asked
  permission for routine technical decisions.

## What it's not

The Concierge is not:

- An engineer (the executor writes code).
- An architect (SEA designs systems).
- A requirements analyst (SRD facilitates specs).
- A designer or strategist (those are separate specialist plugins).

It's a **coordinator and translator**. That's the load-bearing role
non-technical founders need filled when working with an AI marketplace.

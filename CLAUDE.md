# Sulis AI Standards

This repo is **Sulis AI's Claude Code plugin marketplace**. It serves two purposes:

1. **Custom marketplace** — point Claude Code at this repo via `extraKnownMarketplaces` to discover and install plugins.
2. **Plugin source** — contains the `srd` plugin (and any future plugins) with skills, agents, hooks, and reference standards.

## Required Reading

Before creating or modifying any skill, read `docs/skill-authoring-guide.md` and `CONTRIBUTING.md` in full.

## Adding a New Skill

1. Create a directory under `plugins/srd/skills/` named after the skill.
2. Add a `SKILL.md` file inside that directory. This is the skill's prompt entrypoint.
3. Include `references/`, `scripts/`, or `examples/` subdirectories as needed.
4. Test locally by running the skill from a project that has the plugin installed.
5. Open a PR and get it reviewed.

## Testing Locally

To test a plugin skill without publishing:

1. In the project where you want to test, add this repo's path to your local Claude Code settings:
   ```json
   {
     "extraKnownMarketplaces": ["/path/to/standards"]
   }
   ```
2. Or run directly:
   ```bash
   claude --plugin-dir ./plugins/srd
   ```
3. Run the skill via its slash command (e.g. `/srd:critical-thinking`).

## Non-Negotiables

Four rules. If a plan would violate any of these, the plan is wrong.

1. **New code: no implementation without a failing test first.** Write the test, see it
   fail, then write code. The REFACTOR step is not optional — it is where shared
   primitives get extracted. (EP-02)

2. **Check before building new.** Before creating any component, verify that no existing
   component can be extended or adapted. Search the codebase first. When you find two or
   more components implementing the same pattern — stop and extract the shared primitive
   before continuing. Do this in the same PR, not "later." (EP-03)

3. **Existing code: leave every file better than you found it — but prove behaviour
   first.** When you touch a file, review what's already there. For structural changes
   (extracting functions, splitting classes, changing interfaces), follow Fowler's
   refactoring discipline: write a characterisation test, confirm it passes, refactor,
   confirm it still passes. Mechanical changes (renames, dead code removal, import
   cleanup) do not require a characterisation test. (EP-07)

4. **Scope your improvements.** Boy Scout improvements apply to the file you are working
   in. If an improvement requires changes across multiple files, capture it and plan it
   as a separate piece of work — not an unbounded side-quest from your current PR. (EP-07)

For full detail on these principles, see `plugins/srd/references/engineering-principles.md`
and `plugins/srd/references/security-standard.md`.

### Quality Gates

Before every commit, verify:
- All tests pass
- No linting errors
- No type errors
- No known issues deferred
- A plan with no test strategy is incomplete regardless of how detailed the implementation is

### Conscious Deferral

If deferral is genuinely necessary (production incident, insufficient context to refactor
safely, time-critical delivery), add a comment in the code at the point of deferral.
Adapt the syntax to your project's language:

```
// TODO(deferred): Extract shared validation logic from OrderService and PaymentService
// REASON: Insufficient test coverage on PaymentService to refactor safely
// RESOLVE_BY: 2026-03-25
// PR: https://github.com/org/repo/pull/142
```

Undocumented deferral is not acceptable. A documented deferral is a decision; an
undocumented one is negligence.

## Severity Convention

Used consistently across all standards files:

| Severity | Meaning |
|----------|---------|
| **MUST** | Non-negotiable. Violations block delivery. |
| **SHOULD** | Default behaviour. Deviation requires explicit justification documented in the plan. |
| **MAY** | Permitted option. Use judgement. |

---

## Standards Authorship & Evolution

Standards are living documents. When a principle proves wrong, incomplete, or impractical
in practice, raise it — don't work around it silently.

New principles start at SHOULD with a 90-day calibration note. Promotion to MUST requires
evidence from 3+ executions. Demotion or removal requires documented rationale.

All changes to standards files are tracked in the version history section of the relevant file.
